Speak to me The words I adore Whilst heavens fall

Console me with a kiss to heal a broken heart and show me sunshine.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
An old tavern tale warned of an weary old ghost Beneath the water

Whispering in echo like a stray dream about great riches shrivelled in
darkness

Festered by my own fate Do I hear a siren I wonder? When the night is
nigh No stars above high

# ballad of a lonely angel

### Doctor Who inspired poem.

Once far away ashore Demons knock a four, As they declared war, Good man
strike afore

As the enemies piled, whom dared and defiled, ran at the mercy, of the
timeless child.

At the enemies' door All scattered and tore; Weathered by the gore,
Warrior swore no more.

Edge of the graveyard Blue box all scarred Time to face Valeyard A
legend be carved

# Cool-Aid for a Cold Heart

Is it outrageous to imagine, what he had better than I did? But you
chose him, so I guess its time that I close this lid I think about you
all day and everyday It's such a shame things turned out this way

I wouldn't change everything that happened between us For what it's
worth; every moment with you felt luxurious Wish things weren't that
preposterous But I should've known it's pretty obvious

I Wonder if you thought about me after breaking my heart? Could I tell
you how I'm picking up the pieces part by part? Wish it was that easy to
stay apart But this hurts way more than a poison dart

You told me that I could reach out But you've opted to stay out It hurts
more than you could lay out While your fiancé caresses you at your day
out

I Wish there's something that could be done I'll just shrug it off like
a bad pun I'm just a yarn that's unspun I wish nothing but best, hoping
your life will be fun.

# Cutout

I think about you every night I think you had every right For the things
I said It's time that I get paid

Guess I'm not cut out for this shit

It makes it easier for my pain To think you hate me in vain For the shit
you had to put up with Is there anything I can do to shrink this width?

Guess I'm not cut out for this shit

All the lies you've found I go around in the merry-go-around Things
aren't just the same anymore How do I convince myself that you're no
more?

Guess I'm not cut out for this shit

I miss it when you let me hold you closer It's more obvious that I can't
have that forever I wish it's not true that I need you more than ever
Baby! I feel like I'm drowning in a mud river

Guess I'm not cut out for this shit
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
Days getting shorter Mind's getting dafter Can't hear no laughter What
is it that I am after?
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# Even after you're gone

I promise The stars will still Remain in the sky tomorrow night
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# Faith haven't wavered yet.

I hear a hollow thumping as I wait for dark. A call to worship, While
searching my soul.

Destined to die in battle Thrown in the muck. I keep a reticent heart
open, Drowning my stress in quiet.

Ascribe it to ignorance Bloated beyond recognition As I astride my grave
I ask myself, what is it that I seek?
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# Fingerprints on my phone screen won't go away

When the minutes turned to months It hurts more than loosing funds I
could confront you blunt But I'll look like a dunce

Remember when you replied fast? Hard to imagine it was in the past
Scrolling through my draft There lies, all things I should've asked

I'm weathered and faded It hurts when you betrayed and traded My mind
updated as heart dilated This hurt feels weighted and I am negated.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# for now I drink no more

*I'm loosing dreams* *In an ever ending stream* *Among the haunted
screams* *Reaching toward a thwarted gleam (****used****)*

My being burns while I cry Stars fell as I fly One last sigh Before I
die.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# is turning fear into anger being ignorant?

What do I look like to you people? Leaving me on a fucking steeple About
to do something lethal When I'm done, don't bother about retrieval

I am infatuated Now everything's saturated I'm not expecting to be
congratulated All I did seem unsubstantiated

I yearned for the love I deserved Never expected things in turn For all
I care, call me absurd For once I hope I learn
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# Marker Pen

I guess I can write Which is pretty tight But it doesn't deem bright I
hope I ain't right

I can't reach up cos it's out of my height Walls around me blocking my
sight I cannot put up a fight I hope I see some light

I wanna fly high like a kite When I did, everything seemed white When I
realised I lost all my might Guess it's time that I call it a night

Slitting through I feel something slight Stained my floor like the
blight Guess I can finally catch my flight Leaving nothing but a
highlight

# Rigorous Mortis

I waited forever, few moments won't matter I wake every morning and I
start to ponder Is it possible you'll see me I always wonder? As I stand
here like an out of business vendor

You're the only one I want here Will I regret being adhere? All I mean
is sincere When you turn blind eye it hurts severe

I've been thinking before you start blinking Maybe you should stop
skulking because my heart starts breaking; As my ship's done sinking

All around me is this emotional shit Stains my mind like an unsaturated
piss Feels like a beat on an old drum kit Why Is that hard for you to
wiss?
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# Sad Goose

Tears shed in the lawn From dusk till dawn No interest shown Will my
heart ever be sewn?

They say I've changed into something unknown I did cos I was pushed
facedown Ever since I've done nothing but withdrawn Do I need to prove
how I was letdown?

There are things I should've known Shrouded in a dark gown Thrown like a
dead prawn Alone like a fawn, who's time has grown
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# Talg

I see you in the dark Let's hope something sparks I hear something bark
Oh! It's Nothing but a lark

Let's all go all below Why you feel all billow? Again to the rusted
tallow It's time that we allow

I feel a splutter I open the shutter I see someone phatter Shiner than
glitter

Look around the acre You lonely fucker Where's the toy maker? That ain't
no shocker
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# Teller Sounds

Pillow drenched in my sorrow Need someone to hold me mellow As I look
down on you I feel shallow I'm nothing but hollow

I thought I could do this solo I stand in this empty hall that is narrow
I feel confused like a scared sparrow I'm thirsty but I cannot swallow

Behind me there's a shadow That never seems to stop follow I feel like I
am borrowed By some demented fellow

I am nothing but an escrow I feel like a widow My heart's plunged with
an arrow It feels like no below
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# today's no day to fall apart

Out run a rain Before it floods your sorrows
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# trial of the traitor

Age does not wither Stubborn like leather Odds to endeavour Against the
suppressor

Sorrows we never wept Sufferings we kept As darkness crept We overslept

As the end soars away with tainted tears against a festering fear All
aches disappears
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# Útskrá

(It means sign out in Icelandic)

I wish there was a way To make this all go away I don't feel like
writing an essay I've done enough damage anyway

I've told my brain nay Now I'm getting my pay I pray it's any day
Everything around me feels like decay

I'm no different to than an estray Everyone said they'll be here when I
astray Guess it's easy for them run away Don't even know, why I delay?

It's not like I tried to relay I don't own nothing to repay Even if I do
I'd be happy to defray It's time that I belay Now y'all get to see me in
a cold tray

I wonder who will bray I was nothing but a throwaway It's not like I
wanted to forestay I'm glad, that I did, what I had to be on my way.
